Hardware Requirements

To build and run this project, you will need the following hardware components:

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
MFRC522 RFID Reader
Servo motor
16x2 LCD display
RFID tags or cards
Jumper wires
Power supply (5V)

Software Requirements

You'll need the following software tools:

Arduino IDE: To upload the code to the Arduino board.
MFRC522 library: Required to interface with the RFID reader.
Servo library: Used to control the servo motor.
LiquidCrystal library: For working with the LCD display.
Installation
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Open the Arduino IDE.

Install the required libraries if you haven't already. You can install libraries via the Arduino IDE's Library Manager.

Connect your hardware components according to the wiring diagram provided in the project files.

Usage
Open the Arduino IDE and load the Arduino sketch (RFID_DoorLock.ino) from the downloaded project folder.

Select the correct board and COM port from the Arduino IDE's Tools menu.

Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

Open the serial monitor to view the system's output and status.

Present an RFID tag to the reader to test the door lock system.

Configuration
You can customize this project by modifying the following variables in the Arduino sketch:

TAG_ID_1 and TAG_ID_2: Replace these with the unique RFID tag IDs of your authorized users.
